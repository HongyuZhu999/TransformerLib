1. The methods in this paper may be applicable to a variety of encryption algorithms and hardware implementations, improving their efficiency and security.
2. This approach has the potential to improve the throughput of AES S-box, which may lead to smaller implementations depending on the architecture chosen. This suggests that future work may focus on optimizing and simplifying existing designs for more efficient and smaller hardware implementations.
3. The future work aim at measuring the overheads of converting a synchronous design into an asynchronous circuit based on the two-phase bundleddata protocol. The method can be used to assess the leakages to evaluate the robustness of the click-based solution against side-channel attacks.
